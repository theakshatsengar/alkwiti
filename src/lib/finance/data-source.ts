 * The Data Layer boundary.

 * The dashboard reads all financial records through this interface. The mega
 * prompt keeps the actual integration exploratory (Google Sheets, Excel,
 * OneDrive, an API, an MCP connection, ...), and requires that the data source
 * can change later WITHOUT rebuilding the UI. This interface is that seam:
 *
 *   - The presentation layer never imports a concrete source.
 *   - A real source (SheetsDataSource, ApiDataSource, McpDataSource, ...) just
 *     implements this interface and gets swapped in one place.
 *   - No AI layer lives inside the dashboard.
 *
 * All amounts returned MUST be in INR (the source-of-truth currency). A source
 * that pulls foreign-currency invoices is responsible for populating
 * `inrEquivalent` before handing records over.
